Recently Causematch decided to shift from wordpress based platform to React.js+Node.js stack. Causematch has indeed grown a lot in past few years that wordpress has become unable to handle us. We had to move on.

I was from a backend development background, and hence a complete beginner in javascript and now both our backend and frontend was going to be in js but I was excited anyway to learn all the new stuff.

Looking back now, I have come a long way in both React.js and Node.js. Here are few things that helped me on my way.

### Online courses
It is no secret that there are plenty of online courses online. It took me less than 5 minutes to go to udemy.com and find a course with good reviews. Here is the one I chose: <https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux>. Keeping an eye on reviews is the key to selecting a good course. 

I was too lazy to attend online classes for Node.js too, but I bought one anyway. <https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/>

### Reading code
This is what helped me more than anything. If you ask me to choose one method, I'd choose this. Reading code written by other experienced professionals helped me a lot. It not only teaches us the language, but also the way they architect the code and the tools they use.

### Official documentation/reference
Once I started coding, the official documentation and reference helped a lot in pushing through. I focused on reading and understanding the concepts more than coding. The official docs are pretty good for most tools including [react](https://reactjs.org/docs), [redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started), [express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html), [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/getting-started.html) etc. The key is to read more than you code in the beginning. 


So there you go! Online courses will teach you the language, reading code will make you think like a pro and official docs will always help you while coding. There are plenty other tools including books, forums, blogs etc. Choose what works for you, and start coding!
